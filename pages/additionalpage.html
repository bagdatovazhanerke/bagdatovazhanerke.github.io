        Predicts Social Network Size in Humans</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Kevin C Bickart, Mark C Hollenbeck, Lisa Feldman Barrett, Bradford C Dickerson</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent samples of healthy adults, we parsed the amygdala's intrinsic connectivity into three partially distinct large-scale networks that strongly resemble the known anatomical organization of amygdala connectivity in rodents and monkeys. Moreover, in a third independent sample, we discovered that people who fostered and maintained larger and more complex social networks not only had larger amygdala volumes, but also amygdalae with stronger intrinsic connectivity within two of these networks: one putatively subserving perceptual abilities and one subserving affiliative behaviors. Our findings were anatomically specific to amygdalar circuitry in that individual differences in social network size and complexity could not be explained by the strength of intrinsic connectivity between nodes within two networks that do not typically involve the amygdala (i.e., the mentalizing and mirror networks), and were behaviorally specific in that amygdala connectivity did not correlate with other self-report measures of sociality.</p>
    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        Like most primates, humans are a very social species. For humans, other people can be a source of stress or the greatest source of joy. Having a rich social network with many relationships has quantifiable health benefits (Cohen et al., 1997; Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010). Yet people vary greatly from one another in the size of their social networks (Dunbar and Spoors, 1995; Hill and Dunbar, 2003). In 2011, our laboratory demonstrated that individuals with larger amygdala volumes have larger and more complex social networks (Bickart et al., 2011). This initial study extended comparative neuroanatomy findings that, across species, primates living in larger social groupings also have larger amygdalae (Barton and Aggleton, 2000; Barton, 2006). Building on this work, two recent papers have shown that the amygdala's gray matter density is correlated with both online and real-world social network size (Kanai et al., 2012), and seems to increase in monkeys housed in larger social groups (Sallet et al., 2011). Although the amygdala is a key structure within the “social brain” (Brothers, 1990; Lieberman, 2007; Adolphs, 2009), individuals with larger social networks also have more gray matter in other brain regions implicated in adaptive social behaviors such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Bickart et al., 2011), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Lewis et al., 2011), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Sallet et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2012), superior temporal sulcus (STS), temporal pole, and frontal pole (Sallet et al., 2011).

        In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that more socially connected people have brains characterized by stronger intrinsic connectivity between the amygdala and other brain regions subserving social cognition, using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI). Intrinsic connectivity provides a basis for understanding the large-scale anatomic organization of brain networks (Fox and Raichle, 2007), and individual differences in intrinsic connectivity strength within certain networks predicts individual differences in motor function (Fox et al., 2007), memory (Wang et al., 2010), executive function (Seeley et al., 2007), and affect (Seeley et al., 2007; van Marle et al., 2010; Touroutoglou et al., 2012).
        
        Because the amygdala is composed of multiple nuclei with differing connectivity profiles, we first sought to delineate the anatomical networks anchored in the amygdala that might each subserve distinct functions needed to build and maintain larger social networks. Based on our synthesis of published anatomical and functional data in humans and nonhuman animals (see Materials and Methods), we hypothesized that the amygdala would parse into three subregions that each anchor a large-scale network of brain regions implicated in distinct processes of social cognition. The anatomic studies provided a priori hypotheses about the network constitution, and the functional studies supported these hypotheses while providing a priori descriptions of their psychological importance in social cognition. In two independent samples contained in Experiment 1 (n = 89 and n = 83), we tested and replicated our hypothetical neuroanatomical framework using a two-step data-driven fcMRI analytic approach. The results of this first experiment generated three sets of brain regions of interest (ROIs) representing the three hypothesized networks. In the second experiment, using a third independent sample (n = 29), we used the ROIs generated from the first experiment in an a priori fashion to test the hypothesis that the strength of amygdala-based network connectivity would predict social network size and complexity over and above amygdala volume, thereby significantly extending our findings from Bickart et al. (2011).</p>
    <p><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>
    <p>Experiment 1: identifying amygdala-based intrinsic connectivity networks</p>
    <p>Participants</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Discovery sample. The discovery sample consisted of 89 young adults (45 females, age M = 22.4, SD = 3.34, range = 18–33 years) (Yeo et al., 2011; Touroutoglou et al., 2012). Participants were included if they were right-handed, native English speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders with a confirmed absence of DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and were also free of psychoactive medications and had a verbal IQ ≥ 97, performance IQ ≥ 98, and full-scale IQ ≥ 98 as measured by the American National Adult Reading Test. Each participant gave written informed consent in accordance with institutional Human Subjects Research Committee guidelines.
        Replication sample. The replication sample consisted of 83 young adults (53 females, age M = 23.6, SD = 3.13, range = 18–35 years). All participants in this sample fulfilled the same inclusion criteria and consent procedures as the discovery sample.
        Amygdala-based networks important for social connectedness Based on our synthesis of tract-tracing work in rodents and monkeys (Haber and Knutson, 2010; Price and Drevets, 2010; Barbas et al., 2011) and human functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies in social cognition (Moll et al., 2005; Lieberman, 2007; Adolphs, 2009; Rilling and Sanfey, 2011), we developed a hypothetical neuroanatomical framework in which separate subregions of the amygdala each anchor a large-scale network of brain regions subserving distinct processes of social cognition (Fig. 1). Specifically, we hypothesized a network supporting social perception would be anchored in the ventrolateral sector of the amygdala, which contains nuclei that share anatomical connections with sensory association areas of the temporal cortex and OFC (Aggleton et al., 1980; Barbas and De Olmos, 1990; Carmichael and Price, 1995; Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002; Höistad and Barbas, 2008). These regions are implicated in decoding and interpreting social signals from others in the context of past experience and current goals (Morris et al., 1996; Allison et al., 2000; Hart et al., 2000; Phelps et al., 2000; George et al., 2001; Cunningham et al., 2004; Gobbini and Haxby, 2006; Richeson et al., 2008). We hypothesized a network supporting social affiliation would be anchored in the medial sector of the amygdala, which contains nuclei that share anatomical connections with mesolimbic, reward-related areas of the vmPFC, medial temporal lobe, and ventromedial striatum and hypothalamus (McDonald, 1987, 1991a,b; Kunishio and Haber, 1994; Carmichael and Price, 1996; An et al., 1998; Ongür et al., 1998, 2003; Ferry et al., 2000; Ongür and Price, 2000; Fudge et al., 2002; Kondo et al., 2003, 2005; Haber et al., 2006; Hsu and Price, 2007; Price, 2007; Saleem et al., 2008; Haber and Calzavara, 2009; Haber and Knutson, 2010; Price and Drevets, 2010). These regions are implicated in motivating prosocial or affiliative behaviors, such as cooperating with a trustworthy partner or comforting a loved one (Bartels and Zeki, 2004; Rilling et al., 2004; Delgado et al., 2005; Moll et al., 2006, 2007; Harbaugh et al., 2007; Tabibnia et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Zahn et al., 2009; Izuma et al., 2010). Finally, we hypothesized a network supporting social aversion would be anchored in the dorsal sector of the amygdala, which contains nuclei that share anatomical connections with interoceptive, pain-sensitive areas of the caudal ACC (cACC), insula, and ventrolateral striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem (Mufson et al., 1981; McDonald, 1987, 1991a,b; Fudge et al., 2002; Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002). These regions are implicated in motivating avoidant behaviors, such as rejecting cooperation with an unfair partner or avoiding a seemingly untrustworthy stranger (Phillips et al., 1997; Winston et al., 2002; Eisenberger et al., 2003; Sanfey et al., 2003; Moll et al., 2006, 2007; Cheng et al., 2007; Buckholtz et al., 2008; Rilling et al., 2008; Zahn et al., 2009; Kross et al., 2011).</p>
    <p>Experiment 2: amygdala connectivity and social network size</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Participants A third independent sample consisting of 30 young adults (19 females, age M = 24.2, SD = 2.89, range = 19–32 years) was used for the brain-behavior analyses reported in Experiment 2. Using standard self-report measures, participants described their social network size and complexity (Cohen et al., 1997), satisfaction with life (Diener et al., 1985), and availability of social support (Russell et al., 1984). Each also completed structural and resting-state MRI scans. One female participant was excluded from brain-behavior analyses because her computed social network size was 3 SDs greater than the group mean. Amygdala volume and self-report data from 19 participants have been previously published (Bickart et al., 2011). The remaining participants were run after the publication of Bickart et al. (2011). All participants in this sample fulfilled the same inclusion criteria and consent procedures as the two samples reported as part of Experiment 1.
          Self-report data acquisition To assess the size and complexity of participants' social networks in our brain-behavior sample, we used the Social Network Index (SNI) (Cohen et al., 1997), a 13-item questionnaire containing two subscales of interest. The Number of People in Social Network Subscale indexed the size of participants' social networks by counting the total number of people that they interacted with at least once every 2 weeks. The Number of Embedded Networks Subscale indexed the complexity of participants' social networks by counting the total number of different groups with at least four members with whom each participant regularly interacted (e.g., family, friends, church/temple, school, work, neighbors, volunteering, and others). The Number of High-Contact Roles Subscale indexed the diversity of participants' social networks by counting the number of roles that the participant, himself or herself, performed (e.g., mother, child, employer, etc.). Scoring procedures for these subscales can be found online (http://www.psy.cmu.edu/∼scohen/SNIscore.html). As control variables, we also measured participants' reported levels of social support and life satisfaction. We used the Social Provisions Scale (Russell et al., 1984) to assess perceived availability of social support based on participants' views of their current relationships. The scale consists of 24 items (e.g., “I feel part of a group of people who share my attitudes and beliefs.”) rated on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The Social Provisions Scale provides a summary score as well as a score for six provisions of social relationships including guidance (advice or information), reliable alliance (assurance that others can be counted on in times of stress), reassurance of worth (recognition of one's competence), attachment (emotional closeness), social integration (a sense of belonging to a group of friends), and opportunity for nurturance (providing assistance to others). We used the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985) to assess participants' global life satisfaction. The scale consists of five items (e.g., “So far I have gotten the important things I want in life.”) rated on a scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree) and provides an overall life satisfaction score.
          Structural MRI data acquisition and morphometric analysis Imaging data for the brain-behavior sample were collected on a 3T Magnetom Tim Trio system at Massachusetts General Hospital (Siemens), using a 12-channel phased-array head coil. Structural MRI data were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence (TR/TE/flip angle = 2.53 s/3.5 ms/7°, resolution = 1 mm isotropic). To measure amygdala volume, we used FreeSurfer's (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) automated segmentation method, which employs a manually labeled atlas dataset from 40 individuals to automatically segment and assign neuroanatomic ROI labels to 40 different brain structures (including the amygdala) based on probabilistic estimations. Corrections were made for differences in head size by dividing each participant's amygdala volume by estimated total intracranial volume (Buckner et al., 2004). This automated segmentation procedure has been widely used in volumetric studies and was shown to be comparable in accuracy to that of manual labeling (Fischl et al., 2002) and is reliable across sessions within the same scanner (Jovicich et al., 2009). In the present study, each anatomic dataset was processed using the fully automated algorithm and then the amygdala segmentation was manually verified. A trained operator, blind to the hypothesis, manually inspected the results of the automated segmentation. In the present study, no adjustments, modifications, or edits were made; the results of the automated segmentation were verified as accurate without need for correction. The criteria used for this inspection with regard to the amygdala are an in-house laboratory manual of the boundaries of the amygdala (Wright et al., 2006; Entis et al., 2012).
          Resting-state fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing fMRI data for the brain-behavior sample were acquired during rest using a gradient-echo, echo-planar sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (128 contiguous volumes; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°, 33 slices, matrix = 64 × 64; FOV = 200 mm; acquisition voxel = 3.1 × 3.1 × 5.0). During all resting-state fMRI runs, participants were directed to keep their eyes open without fixating and to remain as still as possible. Resting-state fMRI runs were interleaved with task-based fMRI runs, which are unrelated to this study. All preprocessing procedures were identical to that of the discovery and replication samples.
          A priori ROI-based calculation of connectivity strengths in amygdala-based networks For brain-behavior analyses in Experiment 2, we measured the strength of intrinsic connectivity between each of the three amygdala subregions and an average of the signal from all the voxels within its respective large-scale network mask defined independently in the discovery and replication samples. This resulted in three amygdala-network intrinsic connectivity strength (z (r)) values for each participant: z (r)ventrolateral amygdala subregion-perception network, z (r)medial amygdala subregion-affiliation network, and z (r)dorsal amygdala subregion-aversion network.
          Amygdala-network intrinsic connectivity and social network size analysis To test the hypothesis that individual differences in the strength of intrinsic amygdala-network connectivity predict larger social network size, over and above amygdala volume, we conducted a series of linear regression analyses using both amygdala volume (adjusted for intracranial volume) and intrinsic connectivity strength as independent variables and social network size as the dependent variable. For each of the two networks that produced significant results in this hypothesis-driven analysis, we also explored the localization of amygdala subregion connectivity within each large-scale network that best predicted social network size. Using FreeSurfer's implementation of GLM analysis, we entered social network size values as the independent variable and the amygdala-network connectivity strength values as the dependent variable. The resultant map was masked by the network mask defined in the discovery sample as above and results were considered significant if they met the criteria of p < 0.01 with a cluster size constraint of 10 contiguous voxels.
          Finally, to assess the discriminant validity of the a priori hypothesized relationships, we tested whether the strength of connectivity within two social-relevant but nonamygdala-based networks (serving as controls for the prior analyses) predicted variance in social network size and complexity. We defined a mentalizing network composed of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (MNI coordinates 0, 50, 24), precuneus (0, −64, 40), and temporoparietal junction (+/− 50, −58, 24) and a mirror network composed of the ventral premotor cortex (+/− 40, 4, 44), posterior STS (+/− 50, −58, 8), and intraparietal sulcus (+/− 40, −44, 46) using coordinates derived from a recent meta-analysis of mentalizing and mirroring tasks in fMRI studies (Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009). We created spherical nodes, 3 mm in radius, around each of these MNI coordinates and computed pairwise correlations z (r) between the averaged BOLD signal time course in each node. We then computed a composite connectivity strength for each of these networks by averaging across all pairwise z (r) correlations between nodal pairs within the network. We only included nodal pairs that demonstrated pairwise z (r) correlations that were reliably greater than zero in both samples (n = 89 and n = 29) in the calculation of composite connectivity strength scores.
          
          As another test of discriminant validity, we examined whether the strength of connectivity in any of the amygdala networks correlated with other self-report measures of sociality including perceived social support and life satisfaction.
          
          Brain-behavior analyses were conducted using PASW Statistics 18, Release Version 18.0.0 (SPSS, 2009, Chicago, IL, www.spss.com). For these analyses, we selected an α of 0.05.</p>
    <p><b>Results</b></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">As predicted, using the three cortical ROIs as seed regions, the connectional analysis revealed three voxel clusters within the amygdala (Fig. 3b). As predicted, we found the strongest connectivity between the lOFC and the ventrolateral amygdala, the vmPFC and the medial amygdala, and the cACC with the dorsal amygdala. These connectionally defined amygdala subregions strongly resemble the subregions of the amygdala depicted in Figure 1a as well as cytoarchitectonically defined nuclear groups of the amygdala (Fig. 4).</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Using spherical seed ROIs placed within each amygdala subregion (Fig. 5a), we next delineated partially distinct large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity maps (Fig. 5b–d) for a network supporting social perception, a network supporting social affiliation, and a network supporting social aversion; these networks largely resemble the hypothesized networks derived from animal tract-tracing studies and human task-related fMRI studies (Fig. 1b). As predicted, the ventrolateral amygdala subregion showed strongest connectivity with areas important for perceptual processes including the fusiform gyrus and neighboring areas of the ventromedial temporal cortex extending to the pole, as well as the rostral STS, and caudal, medial, and lateral OFC. The medial amygdala subregion showed strongest connectivity with limbic areas important for affiliative behaviors including the vmPFC and neighboring subgenual and rostral ACC, the ventromedial striatum localized largely in the nucleus accumbens, and the ventromedial hypothalamus. Finally, the dorsal amygdala subregion showed strongest connectivity with areas important for aversion behaviors including the cACC, the insula and somatosensory operculum, the ventrolateral striatum localized in the putamen, the caudolateral hypothalamus, and regions in the thalamus and brainstem.</p>
